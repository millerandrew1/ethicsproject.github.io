Thomas:
Neuralink and several other tech companies are working to create a brain-computer interface to read brain waves and understand how they correspond to user thoughts. The problem our group is looking to investigate is how this user data is protected and how vulnerable groups are going to be affected by this technology.

Tanner:
We feel that the disabled people are most likely at risk of their data being sold or stolen as neuralink is advertising the brain chip as a way to help people with disabilities be able to overcome those disabilities.

Andrew:
In order to solve this dilemma a possible solution is to make sure Neuralink is following the consumers right to cognitive liberty, the right to mental privacy, the right to mental integrity, and the right to psychological continuity. To do this we need Neuralink to be more transparent to the public about their intentions with the data they collect and how they plan on keeping those consumer rights.

Roshan:
We are going to spread awareness about this ethical dilemma by creating a website to spread awareness about this issue and hopefully bring awareness to the fact that if they sign up for this their privacy might be in jeopardy.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
